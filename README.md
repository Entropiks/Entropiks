Michael Corseri
================================

Owner @ [FLMR](http://www.flmr.app) - The worlds first and only marketplace to hire surf photographers.
I most recently worked at Acuity Brands as a Senior Software Engineer (frontend) and previously at Bio-Rad as a Lead Web Developer. A passionate and detail-oriented Engineer with a strong focus on building cutting-edge, cross-browser, and device-compatible software. I take great pride in delivering pixel-perfect builds that not only meet but exceed expectations.
