Michael Corseri
================================

Software engineer / developer with a strong focus on building webapps and their frontends (can do backend aswell though). Currently building FLMR - A pioneering SaaS marketplace concept, created to connect surfers with videographers / photographers and provide a secure space to buy and sell content. The platform empowers users to share their passion, monetize their skills, and create valuable connections within the surfing industry. I most recently worked at Acuity Brands as a Senior Software Engineer (frontend) and previously at Bio-Rad as a Lead Web Developer. A passionate and detail-oriented Engineer with a strong focus on building cutting-edge, cross-browser, and device-compatible software. I take great pride in delivering pixel-perfect builds that not only meet but exceed expectations.
