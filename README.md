Hey there! My name is Michael Corseri and I am a frontend engineer currently building FLMR - a marketplace for extreme sports content. I most recently worked at Acuity Brands as a Senior Software Engineer (frontend) and previously at Bio-Rad as a lead web developer. A passionate and detail-oriented Frontend Engineer with a strong focus on building cutting-edge, cross-browser, and device-compatible software.
